///
/// This type is usually used as an orthogonal basis for a ``Transform3D``.
///
/// A `Basis` contains 3 vector fields X, Y and Z as its columns,
/// which are typically interpreted as the local basis vectors of a transformation.
/// For such use, it is composed of a scaling and a rotation matrix, in that order `(M = R.S)`.
///
/// These vectors are usually orthogonal to each other,
/// but are not necessarily normalized (due to scaling).
